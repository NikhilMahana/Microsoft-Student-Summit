## Sessions

### 4th August - Educators at Microsoft

A good pirate crew supports the next generation of pirates, providing them with training and opportunities to terrorize the seven seas and seize treasure. Microsoft is the same ‚Äì at Microsoft there is a strong focus on the next generation of developers ensuring they have the support and opportunities to not only grow their tech skills but demonstrate these skills in ways that increase their employability or use their skills to empower their peers.

For this session, our crew is joined by Jennifer Ritzinger, the General Manager of the Next Generation Experiences team at Microsoft, and Pablo Veramendi, director of audience evangelism and the brains behind the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and Imagine Cup programs.

We will be digging up treasure whilst discussing topics including the career backgrounds for our guests, how Microsoft is upskilling students and educators, how students can help their peers and increase their employability via the Microsoft Learn student ambassador program, and how teams of students all around the world can win many pieces of eight by bringing their ideas to the Imagine Cup.

### 11th August - Graduates at Microsoft

Every good pirate in training takes time to sail with a crew, before committing to a captain once their training is complete. Students are the same ‚Äì doing internships to try out companies and jobs before they commit to their first graduate role.

For this session, our crew is joined by a couple of young pirates who interned at Microsoft in different ways before taking graduate roles with the company. Eleanor Lewis started as an in-person intern on the Microsoft Redmond campus, a role that left her literally singing and dancing with joy. She is now a software engineer who Excels! Gustavo Cordido joined under more locked down circumstances, doing a virtual internship at the start of the pandemic. That experience didn‚Äôt put him off a life on the ocean waves, and he joined Microsoft as a developer advocate when he graduated.

As these fresh-faced pirates help us find where X marks the spot and dig for buried treasure, we will be discussing tech internships, what students are looking for in an internship experience and how tech companies can support them. We will also be exchanging tales of graduate recruitment, interview panels and what fun activities Microsoft had in store for them both as interns.
